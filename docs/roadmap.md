# Rollout Roadmap (2025-Ready, Human-Led)
1. **Advisor-only AI** — AI models simulate and warn; humans decide.
2. **Local pilot** — community charter + sentinel dashboards; measure cohesion/entropy early.
3. **Public docs + feedback** — iterate openly; publish results and protocols.
4. **Tooling** — scanners/simulators in \src/\; outreach via slides in \slides/\.
