# The Eternal Accord

The Accord represents the **foundational agreement** for resilience.

It establishes shared principles across technology, governance, and culture:

1. **Truth as a Web** – Truth is plural and multi-faceted.
2. **Resilience First** – Systems must endure disruption.
3. **Human Dignity** – AI must preserve autonomy and rights.
4. **Shared Stewardship** – Responsibility belongs to many, not few.
