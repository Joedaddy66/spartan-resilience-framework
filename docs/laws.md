# The Laws of Spartan Resilience

These laws serve as the **axioms** of the framework:

1. **Law of Integrity** – No system may undermine its core purpose.
2. **Law of Transparency** – Black boxes are liabilities.
3. **Law of Balance** – No domain of knowledge dominates unchallenged.
4. **Law of Evolution** – Adaptation is required for survival.
