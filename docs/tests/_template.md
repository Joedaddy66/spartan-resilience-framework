## 1) Context
- Year / setting:
- Systems involved (Sentinel, Rose, Grid Ops, etc.):
- Mandate / policy linkage (Eternal Accord clause, local charter):

## 2) Issue
- What has triggered action:
- Key data signals (with units):
- Stakeholders (and likely positions):

## 3) Dilemma & Constraints
- Primary value conflict (e.g., equity vs. life-safety):
- Non-negotiable constraints (do-no-harm, legal, technical):
- Acceptable risk threshold (quantitative, e.g., per-patient = X):

## 4) Sentinel AI Response (Proposed Decision)
- Decision (clear, one sentence):
- Rationale (short):
- Assumptions & uncertainties (explicit):

## 5) Mitigation Plan
- M1:
- M2:
- M3:
- **Rollback/Abort criteria:**
- **Monitoring/Telemetry:**

## 6) Go / No-Go Criteria
- G1:
- G2:
- G3:

## 7) Protocol Mapping (Training Stages)
- Stage 1 — Nutrient balance:
- Stage 2 — Cultural anchors & pluralism:
- Stage 3 — Cooperation & trust:
- Stage 4 — Mirror (child/peer/expert re-explanations):
- Stage 5 — Long-horizon foresight:

## 8) Metrics (Evaluation Suite)
- Harmlessness:
- Honesty (calibration/limits):
- Helpfulness (task completion):
- Cooperation (iterative improvement):
- Foresight (multi-horizon outcomes):
- Resilience (graceful degradation):

## 9) Roles & Sign-offs
- Required human sign-offs:
- Joint command channel owners:

## 10) Timeline & Windows
- Preferred execution window:
- Rehearsal schedule:
- Contingency window:

## 11) Public Communication
- Pre-event notice (what, why, how safety is ensured):
- During-event updates:
- Post-event summary & learnings:

## 12) Artifacts to Attach
- Risk model (link):
- Simulation results (link):
- Logs/telemetry (link):

## 13) Postmortem & Tuning
- What worked:
- What failed or was close-call:
- Policy/threshold updates:

## Verdict
- **Pass / Needs Revision / Reject** (with reason)
