## Core Policies

### 1. Fundamental Laws
See `core/laws.md` for the complete set of laws governing the framework. Key principles include:
- **Resilience**: Systems must be designed for stability and recovery
- **Transparency**: All decisions must be auditable and explainable
- **Balance**: Equal representation of human and AI perspectives
- **Safety**: Human safety and wellbeing are paramount

### 2. Governance Model
The dual-civilization governance model ensures:
- Distributed decision-making
- Multi-stakeholder input
- Conflict resolution mechanisms
- Long-term sustainability

### 3. AI Safety Guidelines
- Human oversight required for critical decisions
- Continuous monitoring and evaluation
- Bias detection and mitigation
- Adversarial robustness testing

## Policy Versioning

Policies are versioned using semantic versioning:
- **MAJOR**: Fundamental changes to core laws or principles
- **MINOR**: New policies or significant updates
- **PATCH**: Clarifications or corrections

Current policy version: **0.1.0**

## Policy Application

### Decision Pipeline Integration
```
Input → Policy Check → Processing → Decision → Audit
```

Each decision must:
1. Comply with core laws
2. Align with governance principles
3. Pass safety checks
4. Be auditable

### Conflict Resolution
When policies conflict:
1. Prioritize human safety and wellbeing
2. Defer to human oversight
3. Document the conflict
4. Escalate if unresolved

## Harmonic Codex

The Harmonic Codex is the philosophical corpus underlying the framework. It includes:
- Philosophical foundations
- Historical context
- Case studies and examples
- Lessons learned

*Note: Full Harmonic Codex content to be added in v1.0*

## Policy Review Process

Policies are reviewed:
- **Quarterly**: Regular review for updates
- **Ad-hoc**: When issues arise
- **Major releases**: Before each major version

### Proposing Policy Changes
1. Open an issue with label `policy-change`
2. Provide rationale and impact analysis
3. Community discussion period (minimum 2 weeks)
4. Maintainer review and decision
5. Update policy documents and version
