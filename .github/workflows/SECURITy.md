## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please **do not** open a public issue for security reports.

1. Email **[REPLACE_WITH_CONTACT_EMAIL]** with:
   - A clear description of the issue and potential impact
   - Steps to reproduce (POC if possible)
   - Affected versions / environment
2. We’ll acknowledge within **48 hours** and keep you updated.
3. We aim to provide a fix and release within **14 days** for high-severity issues.
4. Once patched and released, we’ll coordinate a disclosure window with you.

If you prefer, you can also use **GitHub Security Advisories**:
- Go to the repo → **Security** tab → **Advisories** → **Report a vulnerability** (private).

## Scope
This policy covers the `qpprime` package and this repository. Third-party dependencies should be reported upstream when appropriate.

## Disclosure
We follow **coordinated disclosure**: researchers report privately, we remediate, then mutually agree on a public disclosure timeline.

## Credits
We appreciate responsible research and will credit reporters unless you request anonymity.
