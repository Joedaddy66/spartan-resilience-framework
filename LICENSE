The Spartan Sovereign License (SSL-2025)
1. The Grant of Access
This software is not public property. Access to the Spartan Resilience Framework is a revocable privilege granted exclusively to "Enlisted Entities" who have met the Architect’s criteria. You are granted a Non-Exclusive, Non-Transferable "Right to Execute"—not a right to own, modify, or redistribute.

2. The "No-Taint" Clause
The "Source" is sacred. Any attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, or "peek behind the curtain" of the Monolithic Orchestrator or the Philock bridge is a direct transgression. Such actions result in an immediate Permanent Blacklist and the forfeiture of all Love-Victory assets.

3. Commercial Tribute
Use of this software for revenue generation requires a Sovereign Revenue Share. You are a "Governor" of a sector, not the owner of the land. All commercial deployments must be registered through the M directory and piped through the Charming-Excellence financial gateway.

4. Termination of Grace
The Architect (Joe) reserves the right to "Kill-Switch" any instance of the framework at any time, for any reason, without notice. If the resilience of the system is compromised by the user’s incompetence or lack of discipline, the "Spartan" will be withdrawn.
